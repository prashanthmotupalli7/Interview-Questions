CORE JAVA QUESTIONS :

basic :
explain oops concepts .
difference between jvm jre and jdk
what is encapuslation ?

Stack Vs Heap Java : 
Difference between Constructors and Methods ?
difference between abstract class and interface java 
Can we create an object of an abstract class in Java ?
what are the diff type of inheritance present in java ?
is multiple inheritance supported in java ? How can we achieve mulptile inheritance in java ?
is it possible to extends more than one class in java ?
diff static vs instant variable
diff between method overloading vs method overriding
can we overload constructor in java ?
can we overload static method in java ?
can we override static method in java ?

can child class reference hold parent class object ?
What is singleton class in Java and how can we make a class singleton?
difference between is a relationship and has a relationship in java
Is-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits another class, it is called an IS-A relationship.
Has-A relationship: Whenever an instance of one class is used in another class, it is called HAS-A relationship.

design pattern 
agile methodlogy 
what is object class ?
what are the different method present in object class ? getClass(),clone() , equal(),hashCode(),finalize(),toString(),wait(),notify(),notifyAll()
what are the diff ways to create object in java ?  newInstance() , new keyword , clone() , serilizaiton
what is marker interface ?
What is the use of a transient variable?
Can you access a non-static variable in the static context?
can we overlaod main method ?


3. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java ?
explain thread lifecycle
9. What’s the difference between notify() and notifyAll()?
18. How do threads communicate with each other?
ans : Threads can communicate using three methods i.e., wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().
public void yield(): causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.

21. What is the synchronization process? Why use it ?
 differences between wait() and join() and yield().
wait is used for inter-thread commu and yeild is used to just offer opportunity to another running thread
if join called on one thread in join one thread will not run until another thread end its excution.
wait vs join 
wait is mainly used for shared resources , a thread notifies other waiting thread when resources become free
on other hand join is simply used for wating a thread to die.
sleep : pause thread execution

What is string constant pool in Java?

what are the different interfaces are present in collection framework.
is List is an interface or class ?
what is default size of arrayList? 
what is default bucket size of hashMap ?
what will happened if I put 11th element in arraylist
which method is used to clear arraylist ?

explain interal structure of hashmap .
ans : HashMap contains an array of Node and Node can represent a class having the following objects : 
int hash
K key
V value
Node next

bucket is an element of the HashMap array. It is used to store nodes. Two or more nodes can have the same bucket. In that case, a link list structure is used to connect the nodes. Buckets are different in capacity. A relation between bucket and capacity is as follows: 
capacity = number of buckets * load factor
A single bucket can have more than one node, it depends on the hashCode() method. The better your hashCode() method is, the better your buckets will be utilized. 

Calculate hash code of Key {“vishal”}. It will be generated as 118.
Calculate index by using index method it will be 6.
Create a node object 

Place this object at index 6 if no other object is presented there.
In this case, a node object is found at index 6 – this is a case of collision.
In that case, check via the hashCode() and equals() method if both the keys are the same.
If keys are the same, replace the value with the current value.
Otherwise, connect this node object to the previous node object via linked list and both are stored at index 6. 



load factor in hashmap ?
default 75%
Size of hashmap (m)/number of buckets (n)  

In this case, the size of the hashmap is 1, and the bucket size is 16. So, 1/16=0.0625. Now compare this value with the default load factor.
0.0625<0.75
So, no need to increase the hashmap size.

can we add map object inside list ? 
what is concurrentHashMap ?
what is copyOnWriteArrayList ? 
when concurrentmodificationexception occured ?

angular :
diff between ngIF and ngshow nghide
how to create custom directive
diff between let and var
Sharing data between child and parent directives and components

@Input() and @Output() give a child component a way to communicate with its parent component.
 @Input() lets a parent component update data in the child component. Conversely,
 @Output() lets the child send data to a parent component.

child c

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'; // First, import Input
export class ItemDetailComponent {
  @Input() item = ''; // decorate the property with @Input()
}

<app-item-detail [item]="currentItem"></app-item-detail>

parent c

export class AppComponent {
  currentItem = 'Television';
}
